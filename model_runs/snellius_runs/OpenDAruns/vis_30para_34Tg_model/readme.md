About the experiment

This calibration experiment is for a horizontal viscosity in the canada model. 
The region for horizontal viscosity is defined by a polygon covering hudson bay.

We divide the region in approximately 30 parameters. With each parameter having around 10 points. 

So, around 3000 points as output from the canada model. 

Now, we use observations for march from the CHS TG for 34 points in the domain of the polygon. 

Please note that the observations are not available through stochObserver, but we point to another folder for the same. 

In snellius we would likewise need such a folder.




the model ran and converged with almost no change in cost function. The reason behind it was very low change in relTolerance.
Idea would be to reduce the number of parameters.

Also, change the CHSTG data output points to points which are wet.
