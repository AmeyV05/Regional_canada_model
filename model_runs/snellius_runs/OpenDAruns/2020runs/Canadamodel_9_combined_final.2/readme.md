About the experiment

In this experiment we calibrate bf bathymetry and viscosity all together for sea ice. 

A combined calibration I believe will work better because the sea ice is very low in september and currently it's effect is probably
not seen in many regions and a calibration after doesn't really have much influence on TG data. plus the effect is nonlinear. 

A combined final version has updates like one extra parameter each for bf and bathymetry but also, towards fast ice calibration the a finer version of
bf is used so that we can develop a script later to modify the friction on non0fly.

The sea ice is modelled as fast ice and drifting sea ice separately. With the two separate regions for them.

In september we assume almost no fast ice. And so, we are left with only drifting sea ice. 

We use only CHS TG observations since some TG are not good we remove a few of them and are only left with.


Please note that the observations are not available through stochObserver, but we point to another folder for the same. 

In snellius we would likewise need such a folder.
