About the experiment

In this experiment, we are trying to re-calibrate (after Xiaohui's calibration) the bathymetry and bottom friction in the canadian region.

Here, the approach is that:
we run for the month of September the calibration of bathymetry and bf.

17 bathymetry domains and 12 bf friction domains are made. 

The sea ice is modelled as fast ice and drifting sea ice separately. With the two separate regions for them.

In september we assume almost no fast ice. And so, we are left with only drifting sea ice. 

We use only CHS TG observations of the 154 TG. 


Please note that the observations are not available through stochObserver, but we point to another folder for the same. 

In snellius we would likewise need such a folder.
