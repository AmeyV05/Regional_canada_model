About the experiment

In this experiment we calibrate the bathymetry, bottom friction for September and not the other params. 

There are in 17 bf, 21 bathymetry , 
The Chezynet file used to give the effective chezy to the model domain.


We use only CHS TG observations and  since some TG are not good we remove a few of them and are only left with 117.


Please note that the observations are not available through stochObserver, but we point to another folder for the same. 

In snellius we would likewise need such a folder.
