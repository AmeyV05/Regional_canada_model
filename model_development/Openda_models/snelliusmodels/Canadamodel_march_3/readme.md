About the experiment

In this experiment we calibrate the fast ice and viscosity for march. 

WE change with no fice calibration and only viscosity calibration. 

bf v6 and bathy v7 were used.  

We use only CHS TG observations since some TG are not good we remove a few of them and are only left with.


Please note that the observations are not available through stochObserver, but we point to another folder for the same. 

In snellius we would likewise need such a folder.
