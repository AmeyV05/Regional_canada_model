This folder contains all the experimental setups and scripts to setup these experiments.

In snelliusmodels you will find the different experimental setups.

In parameters there are jupyter notebooks which deal with processing the data to 
create the correct experimental setup with each parameter. 

Observations contains the observations for each experiment. It is obtianed by processing as seen in jupyter notebook Create_observations_xmlfiles.

This notebook is also responsible for creating correct .xml files.

**NOTE**

most of the scripts and notebook files were created from the this directory as header. But later on moved to different subfolder (on 3rd May 2022). That is why, it might be that some scripts won't work directly and could need certain paths to locate the correct files.
